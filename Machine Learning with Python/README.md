Pythoncodes about Machine Learning form the Youtubetutorial "Machine Learning with Python" from the Youtuber Sentdex.
You can watch his Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v).

Due to updates in Python, the Pythoncodes Sentdex shows don't work sometimes.
The Pythoncodes in this Git are updated Versions of Sentdex's Codes. 

(More Codes will be added soon)
