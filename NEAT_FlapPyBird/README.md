# NEAT-FlapPyBird

Using NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT)
to let an AI play Flappybird. 
NEAT was first implemented by [Ken Stanley](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) and is a genetic algorithm (GA) for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks.

You need the NEAT-Package for Python to be installed. The NEAT-Pythonâ€™s documentation, which you can find [here](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), explains this quite well.

In the Runwinner_save folder are my best config and best/fittest genomes using two different fitnessfunktions.
